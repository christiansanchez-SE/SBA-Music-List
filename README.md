Creating this was a bit hard. I didnt have much time throughtout the weekend.

Reflection:
What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the
execution easier?
Have a something planned correctly. I felt this project was rushed for me and didnt get enough time to come up with a better idea

Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them
easier to implement in future projects?
The JavaScript was a bit harder for me. Wishing that i explored more options and looked for extra help.

What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

I would probably add different color schemes and as well with some pictures.
